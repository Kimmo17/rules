## 1. Introduction & Scope

### 1.1. Purpose and Authority

The **Ibex Gaming League (IGL)** organises competitive esports tournaments and leagues across various gaming titles. These competitions are governed by these **Official Rules** ("**Rules**" or "**Rulebook**"), together with **game-specific rulebooks** and **competition-specific regulations**, where applicable.

These Rules serve to:

- Ensure fair, transparent, and consistent competition across all Ibex Gaming League events
- Establish a clear legal framework and procedures for all stakeholders
- Provide binding guidelines for competitors, teams, administrators, and other participants
- Protect the integrity and reputation of competitive esports

### 1.2. Skill-Based Competition Declaration

**IMPORTANT LEGAL DISCLAIMER:** IGL competitions are **skill-based competitive events** that reward gaming proficiency, strategic thinking, teamwork, and competitive performance. These competitions are **NOT games of chance** within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Act on Money Games (AMG). Success in IGL competitions depends entirely on participant skill, preparation, and performance, not random chance or luck. Prize awards are based solely on competitive achievement and ranking.

### 1.3. Legal Framework and Binding Nature

By participating in any IGL competition, all participants ("**Competitors**," "**Players**," "**Teams**") unconditionally accept and agree to be bound by:

1. These Official Rules
2. Applicable game-specific rulebooks
3. Competition-specific regulations
4. All decisions made by IGL administrators and officials

**Administrative decisions made by IGL officials regarding competition matters are final and binding, except where appeal rights are specifically provided in Section 8 (Appeals Process) or where prohibited by applicable Swiss law. This finality clause does not limit participants' statutory rights under Swiss consumer protection, data protection, or other mandatory legal provisions.**

### 1.4. Applicability and Territorial Scope

These Rules apply to **all games and competitions organised by the Ibex Gaming League**, regardless of where participants are located, provided the competition or its effects occur within Switzerland or involve Swiss residents.

Each game title shall have **its own specific rulebook**, and individual competitions may introduce **additional special regulations**. Such special rules shall be published on the respective competition pages at **[ibexgaming.org](https://ibexgaming.org)** prior to the commencement of the relevant competition.

### 1.5. Rule Hierarchy

In cases of conflict between rules, the following hierarchy applies (in descending order of precedence):

1. **Applicable Swiss Federal and Cantonal Law**
2. **Competition-Specific Regulations** (published per event)
3. **Game-Specific Rulebook** (e.g., CS2, Rocket League, R6)
4. **Ibex Gaming League Official Rules** (this document)

### 1.6. Administrative Structure

The administration of IGL competitions is structured as follows:

- **Game Day Admin:** Responsible for operational decisions during live competition days
- **Game Admin:** Oversees game-specific competitions and supervises Game Day Admins
- **Head Admin:** Oversees all game competitions, manages the administrative team, and serves as the final authority on competitive decisions
- **IGL Esports Council:**  Independent body responsible for competitive governance (see Section 1.7).

**Note:** Individuals may hold multiple administrative roles depending on competition requirements and organisational structure.

### 1.7. Governance and Appeals
The **IGL Esports Council** operates as an independent oversight body responsible for:

- Creating and maintaining rulebooks, formats, and fair play guidelines
- Supervising referees, administrators, and competition officials
- Evaluating formal proposals from participants
- Managing competitive calendars and approving game-specific settings
- Ensuring competitive integrity and governance

The Esports Council operates **independently within its defined scope** and **does not have authority over financial, legal, or administrative matters** of the IGL organisation . Its complete composition, authority, and procedures are defined in the IGL Statutes.

### 1.8. Rule Modifications
Ibex Gaming reserves the right to update these Rules, game-specific rulebooks, or competition-specific regulations at any time, subject to the following conditions:

- **Participants shall be notified in writing of any material changes** no less than seven (7) days prior to implementation, except in cases of legal compliance or emergency
- Changes that materially affect competition outcomes shall **not be applied retroactively** unless required for legal compliance, competitive integrity, or fairness
- Minor clarifications or technical corrections may be implemented immediately with appropriate notice

### 1.9. Unforeseen Circumstances
Where circumstances arise that are **not explicitly covered by these Rules**, the Head Admin and IGL Esports Council have authority to make decisions in the best interest of competitive integrity, fairness, and legal compliance. Such decisions shall be documented and may form the basis for future rule amendments.
