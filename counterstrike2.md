##### For Remaining Maps:

- The winner of the knife round selects which side their team will start on

##### For Picked Maps:
- The team that did not pick the map selects the starting side

### 4.4. Match Start Protocol

- Both teams must be ready **15 minutes before match time**
- Ibex Gaming League will provide server IPs to team captains at least 30 minutes before the scheduled match time
- In exceptional circumstances, teams may request admin assistance for alternative server arrangements
- Third-party provided servers might be used (e.g. Faceit) if necessary

### 4.5 Timeout
To call a timeout, participants have to use the in-game vote system (ESC → Call Vote → Call
Tactical Timeout). A timeout lasts thirty (30) seconds. Participants are allowed to take all
three timeouts at once by calling them all individually once the previous timeout expires.

If a map reaches overtime (OT), all remaining timeouts will be removed and each team will
receive one (1) timeout to be used in that OT (OT1) period. If the map progresses to another
OT (OT2), the same process will happen - any remaining timeouts will be removed, and each
team will receive one (1) more timeout. Banked timeouts cannot be stacked higher than one
(1) in overtime.
